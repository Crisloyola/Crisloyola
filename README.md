Hey there! 👋  
I’m **Cristopher**, a web developer based in **Peru 🇵🇪**.

I design and build practical digital solutions.

When an idea makes sense, I turn it into code and ship it.

My main tech stack includes **JavaScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS**.  
Lately, I’ve been focusing more on **backend development and databases**, aiming to build solid and scalable systems.

I’ve worked on multiple projects for businesses and personal growth.  
One of the projects I’m most proud of is **ApexCAD Perú**, built with **Next.js & Tailwind CSS**.

I’ve built many public repositories, and privately even more experiments, prototypes, and ideas that helped me improve as a developer.

If you want to see what I build, check out my pinned repositories below.
